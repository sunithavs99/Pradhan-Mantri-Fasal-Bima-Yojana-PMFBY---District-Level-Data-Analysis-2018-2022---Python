# Pradhan-Mantri-Fasal-Bima-Yojana-PMFBY---District-Level-Data-Analysis-2018-2022---Python
This repository contains a Python-based data analytics main project on PMFBY (Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana). The project covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical summaries, visualizations, and insight generation to study farmer coverage, demographic patterns, and scheme performance across states and years.

📌 Project Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) dataset using Python for Data Analytics.
The objective is to understand farmer participation, insurance coverage trends, demographic composition, and financial patterns across different years, seasons, states, and farmer categories. The project follows a complete data analytics workflow starting from data understanding to insight generation and visualization.

🎯 Project Objectives:

* Analyze farmer participation trends across years and seasons
* Study loanee vs non-loanee participation patterns
* Understand demographic composition (gender, social categories, landholding size)
* Identify relationships between insurance coverage and financial indicators
* Generate meaningful insights and business recommendations using data

🗂️ Dataset Description:

The dataset contains district-level PMFBY data with information related to
* Farmer enrollment
* Area and sum insured
* Premium and subsidy contributions
* Gender, social category, and landholding distribution
* Credit-linked (loanee) and non-credit-linked (non-loanee) farmers

Key features include
* Year, season, state, district
* Total farmers covered
* Area insured and sum insured
* Farmer, Government of India, and State premium shares
* Gender and social category distribution
* Small and marginal farmer participation

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas – data manipulation and analysis
* NumPy – numerical computations
* Matplotlib – data visualization
* Seaborn – advanced visualizations

📈 Project Workflow:

1️⃣ Data Understanding & Preparation

* Loaded and inspected the dataset
* Checked data types and structure
* Handled missing values and inconsistencies
* Created derived metrics such as participation percentages

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Univariate analysis to understand individual variables
* Bivariate analysis to compare relationships between two variables
* Multivariate analysis using groupby, pivot tables, and correlations
* Statistical summaries using describe()

3️⃣ Correlation Analysis

* Analyzed relationships between numerical indicators
* Studied how financial variables move together
* Examined demographic and participation correlations

4️⃣ Data Visualizations

* Bar plots for season-wise and category-wise comparisons
* Line charts for year-wise trends
* Pie charts for participation shares
* Histograms and box plots for distribution analysis
* Heatmaps for correlation analysis
* Subplots used where applicable for better comparison
* All visualizations include proper titles, labels, legends, and formatting.

5️⃣ Insight Generation & Report

* Summarized key findings from analysis
* Identified major patterns, trends, and gaps
* Provided business-friendly interpretations
* Suggested strategic actions and recommendations

🔍 Key Insights (Summary):

* Farmer coverage under PMFBY has increased significantly over the years
* Loanee farmers dominate participation, indicating strong credit linkage
* Small and marginal farmers form the majority of beneficiaries
* Gender imbalance persists with lower female participation
* Financial indicators such as premium and sum insured move strongly together
* Regional and seasonal variations affect enrollment levels

💡 Business Recommendations:

* Improve outreach to non-loanee farmers to increase voluntary enrollment
* Introduce targeted awareness programs to reduce the gender gap
* Strengthen insurance access in tribal and underrepresented regions
* Enhance digital and local support during high-participation seasons
